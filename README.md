## üìù Problem Statement
In the modern financial landscape, the influx of loan applications poses significant challenges for institutions. Manual evaluation of these applications is time-consuming and prone to error. Our task was to build a **machine learning‚Äìpowered loan eligibility prediction system** to automate the decision of approving or rejecting loan requests, thus streamlining the approval process.

| self_employed               | Employment status |
| income_annum                | Annual income |
| loan_amount                 | Requested loan amount |
| loan_term                   | Loan term (years) |

## üìà Project Flow
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Problem definition + dataset selection**  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Data preprocessing:** handled nulls, cleaned categories, converted categorical features to numerical  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **EDA:** histograms, box plots, KDE plots, correlation matrix, pair plots  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Feature scaling:** MinMaxScaler and StandardScaler  
5Ô∏è‚É£ **Model selection:** Logistic Regression + Random Forest  
6Ô∏è‚É£ **Model evaluation:** accuracy, recall, confusion matrix, classification report  
7Ô∏è‚É£ **Model export:** best model + scaler saved for deployment

## ‚úÖ Final Model
After rigorous evaluation, the **best model** is:
- **Random Forest Classifier with MinMaxScaler**
- **Accuracy:** 0.98  
- **Recall:** 0.99  
- **Confusion Matrix:**

|                | Predicted Rejected (0) | Predicted Approved (1) |
|----------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| **Actual Rejected (0)** | 305                   | 13                    |
| **Actual Approved (1)** | 7                     | 529                   |

- **Reason for selection:** High accuracy and recall with balanced performance across both loan approval and rejection classes.

## üíæ Deployment
We exported:
- `rf_minmax.pkl` ‚Äî trained Random Forest model  
- `minmax_scaler.pkl` ‚Äî corresponding MinMaxScaler  

‚úÖ The model is ready for deployment via **Flask API**, **Streamlit app**, or on **Fly.io / Render / Heroku**.

---

## üîç Key Insights
- **CIBIL score** is the most significant factor influencing loan approval.
- **Income and loan amount** are positively correlated ‚Äî higher income generally means larger loans.
- **Asset values** (luxury, residential) correlate with financial stability and loan amount.

---

## üöÄ Next Steps
- Enhance model with additional features (e.g. employment duration, location data).  
- Deploy as a scalable web service for real-time loan eligibility prediction.
